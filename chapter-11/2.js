//             SYNC IN JS

// SYNCHRONOUS
// Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instructions waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.


// Asynchronous
// Due to synchronous programming , sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions , which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allows to execution allows to execute next instructions immediateley and doesn't block the flow.
